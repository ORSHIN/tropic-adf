# AttackDefense Framework (ADF)

## Introduction

This repository is a fork of the original [AttackDefense Framework (ADF)](https://github.com/francozappa/adf) — a threat-modeling framework for IoT devices and lifecycles.

The aim of this fork is to establish a relationship with the newly introduced [MITRE EMB3D™ Threat Model](https://emb3d.mitre.org/), which has some advantages over ADF, including faster modeling over a fixed structure of attack surfaces (EMB3D Device Properties).

On the other hand, the flexibility and easy-to-adopt approach of ADF make it possible to extend and enrich the MITRE EMB3D™ Threat Model by intermapping threats with a custom ADF database, allowing rapid and more precise threat modeling at the same time.

Additionally, we provide a comprehensive database of ADF files based on the list of AD objects created in the ORSHIN project as a starting point for detailed modeling of constrained CMOS devices, where the MITRE EMB3D is not very detailed.

The ADF repository has the following structure:

* `catalog/` contains the AD files
* `analyze.py` automatically analyzes ADs (maps, chains, trees, ...)
* `check.py` checks syntax and semantics of the ADs
* `parse.py` parses ADs from other sources (CAPEC, ...)
* `*_test.py` test scripts
* `Makefile` runs tests, scripts, etc

This repository fork has been extended by the following content compared to the original [AttackDefense Framework (ADF)](https://github.com/francozappa/adf) (see [Connecting AD Catalog with MITRE EMB3D](#connecting-ad-catalog-with-mitre-em3ed) for a detailed description):

* `catalog-mitre/` AD file catalog with content from `catalog` deduplicated and optimized for generic use in the area of constrained devices
* `dict/` contains the definition of the newly added AD dictionary: allowed phrases for `surf`, `vect`, `model`, and `tag`
* `check_tool.py` checks syntax and semantics of the ADs, extended by:
  - the ability to compare two AD files and rank ability between ADs
  - the ability to use ADF dictionaries
  - the ability to generate the ADF dictionary from the AD file
* `mitre/` MITRE EMB3D-related resources
* `visualization/` shows the MITRE EMB3D–ADF database relationship by means of the hierarchically structured generated static web page

## AD object

The ADF utilizes the *AttackDefense (AD)* object to model a threat.
An AD is a named data structure with primary and optional fields. An AD can be
written in any serialization language like YAML
(preferred), JSON, XML, TOML, and so on. It is also programming-language
agnostic as it can be represented by a dictionary. It is machine and human
friendly.


```yaml
ad_name:
  # Primary fields
  a: attack
  d:
    policy1: [mech1, mech2]
    policy2: [mech1, mech2]
    ...
  surf: [surf, subsurf, subsubsurf, ...]
  vect: [vector1, vector2, ...]
  model: [model1, model2, ...]
  tag: [tag1, tag2, ...]
  # Optional fields
  risk: [score1, score2, ...]
  year: 2023
  cve: ["123", "456", ...]
  cwe: ["123", "456", ...]
  capec: ["123", "456", ...]
  vref: ["vendor-ref1", ...]
  ...: ...
```

Above, we show an AD represented as a YAML object. The AD includes a set of
*primary fields*:
* unique name (`ad_name`)
* attack description (`a`)
* high-level defense policies and concrete defense mechanisms (`d: policy1: [mech1, mech2]`)
* attack surface (`surf`)
* attack vector (`vect`)
* general-purpose tags (`tag`)

Moreover, the AD is extensible with *optional fields*. Below we describe some
that we used in our experiments:
* risk scores (`risk`)
* threat year (`year`)
* CWE, CVE, and CAPEC IDs (`cve`, `cwe`, `capec`)
* vendor references (`vref`)

To see other AD representations look at [template/](template).


## Modules

The ADF has *four* modules:

1. **Catalogue** contains a curated collection of YAML files. Each file
   includes a collection of ADs for a threat domain (see [catalog/](catalog)).
2. **Analyze**: describe analyze API (`analyze.py`) and tests (`analyze_test.py`).
3. **Check**: describe analyze API (`check.py`) and tests (`check_test.py`).
4. **Parse**: describe analyze API (`parse.py`) and tests (`parse_test.py`).

## Cryptowallet case study

We evaluated the ADF by running a threat modeling exercise on a
*cryptowallet (product)*
and its *life cycle (process)*.
We involved seven expert groups covering orthogonal threat categories spanning
hardware, software, firmware, security, privacy, and protocols.

1. **Security Pattern** (lead: Gringiani) covered *ETSI EN 303 645 process threats*.
   They produced 9 ADs in [etsi.yaml](catalog/etsi.yaml).
2. **KUL COSIC** (lead: De Meulemeester) covered *side channel and
   fault injection threats*.
   They produced 20 ADs in [side-channel-phy.yaml](catalog/side-channel-phy.yaml)
3. **KUL DistriNet** (lead: Bognar) covered *microarchitectural and speculative execution threats*.
   They produced 14 ADs in [microa.yaml](catalog/microa.yaml).
4. **NXP Germany** (lead: Bezsmertnyi) covered *presilicon RISC-V secure element threats*.
   They produced 8 ADs in [presil.yaml](catalog/presil.yaml).
5. **Texplained** (lead: Thomas) covered *invasive physical IC threats*.
   They produced 26 ADs in [physical.yaml](catalog/physical.yaml).
6. **EURECOM** (lead: Sacchetti) covered *BLE protocol and implementation threats*.
   They produced 46 ADs in [bt.yaml](catalog/bt.yaml).
7. **Security Pattern** (lead: Gringiani) covered *FIDO2 authentication threats*.
   They produced 21 ADs in [fido_device.yaml](catalog/fido_device.yaml),
   [fido_solokey.yaml](catalog/fido_solokey.yaml), and
   [fido_system.yaml](catalog/fido_system.yaml).


## Connecting AD Catalog with MITRE EMB3D

### Generic AD Catalog for Constrained CMOS Devices

An original [catalog/](catalog) created by the expert groups was reviewed and slightly modified, and [catalog-mitre/](catalog-mitre) was created in the following steps:
  - removed deprecated files and examples
  - created AD database files to closely reflect the MITRE EMB3D structure
  - merged similar and overlapping AD objects
  - to improve consistency, we prefer the use of **Title Case** style (in dictionaries and through ADs as a consequence) for `surf`, `vect`, `model`, and `tag` terms.

The resulting AD database files were validated, and noncompliance with respect to YAML and ADF standards was fixed.

Additionally, dictionaries in [dicts/](dicts) were created to simplify validation.
[Dictionaries](dicts) contain allowed phrases and the description of `surf`, `vect`, `model`, and `tag`. Additionally, they allow linkage with MITRE by Threat IDs (TID) connected to top-level attack vectors, and MITRE Device Properties (PID) connected to main attack surfaces.
The `check_tool.py` enforces that at least one (the most top-level) AD's attack surface must be linked with a MITRE TID.

The resulting [catalog-mitre](catalog-mitre) contains deduplicated ADs interlinked with MITRE EMB3D by TIDs connected to top-level attack surfaces and PIDs connected to top-level attack vectors, allowing mapping ADs to MITRE EMB3D threats and device properties.


### AD Checker Tool Examples

#### Creating Dictionary from AD File

```bash
python3 check_tool.py -i catalog-mitre/physical.yaml -g > dicts/physical.yaml
```

#### Validate the AD Dictionary

```bash
python3 check_tool.py -i dicts/physical.yaml
```

#### Validate the AD File

To validate AD file syntax, run:
```bash
python3 check_tool.py -i catalog/fido_device.yaml
ERR : AD format not compliant with schema!

python3 check_tool.py -i catalog/fido_device.yaml -v
DBG : Checking YAML syntax: catalog/fido_device.yaml
DBG : check_yamllint: catalog/fido_device.yaml: passed
ERR : AD format not compliant with schema!
Key 'time_khandles' error:
Key 'risk' error:
<lambda>([]) should evaluate to True
```

To validate AD file syntax, and check the AD structure, use dictionary:
```bash
python3 check_tool.py -i catalog-mitre/physical.yaml -d dicts/physical.yaml
```

#### Compare the Content of Two AD files

```bash
python3 check_tool.py -i catalog-mitre/physical.yaml -c catalog/physical.yaml -d dicts/physical.yaml
```

### Generate ADF Vizualization and/or Threat Model

The ADF Visualization uses Jekyll (a static site generator) to generate a structured view of the threat model.

Ruby and Jekyll must be installed.

On Debian-based distributions, typically run (tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS):

```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev gem
sudo gem install jekyll
```

To generate a threat model, based on the MITRE EMB3D surfaces (PIDs), for a particular device:
- go to the `visualization/_data`
- modify all `model_*.yaml` files to reflect your device needs by removing or adding attack surfaces (PIDs) -  take [model_emb3d.yaml](visualization/_data/model_emb3d.yaml) as a reference

Then execute:

```bash
make model
```

The static page representing a defined threat model is generated: open [visualization/_site/index.html](visualization/_site/index.html).


## Tests

We use `pytest` and `make`.

Test all modules:

```make
make test
```

Test `modname`:

```make
make test-modname
```
