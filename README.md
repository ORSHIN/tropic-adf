# AttackDefense Framework (ADF)

## Introduction

The AttackDefense Framework (ADF) is a threat modeling framework for IoT
devices and life cycles.

In this [blog post](blogpost.md) we explain how we used the ADF to threat model a crypto
wallet.

The repository has the following structure:

* `yaml/` contains the AD files
* `analyze.py` automatically analyze ADs (maps, chains, trees, ...)
* `check.py` check syntax and semantic of the ADs
* `parse.py` parse ADs from other sources (CAPEC, ...)
* `*_test.py` test scripts
* `Makefile` run tests, scripts, etc


## ADF Research Paper (ACM TECS)

The ADF is presented in the [AttackDefense Framework (ADF): Enhancing IoT Devices
and Lifecycles Threat Modeling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3698396)
paper, published in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) in 2024.

## AD object

The ADF utilizes the *AttackDefense (AD)* object to model a threat.
An AD is a named data structure with primary and optional fields. An AD can be
written in any serialization language like YAML
(preferred), JSON, XML, TOML, and so on. It is also programming-language
agnostic as it can be represented by a dictionary. It is machine and human
friendly.


```yaml
ad_name:
  # Primary fields
  a: attack
  d:
    policy1: [mech1, mech2]
    policy2: [mech1, mech2]
    ...
  surf: [surf, subsurf, subsubsurf, ...]
  vect: [vector1, vector2, ...]
  model: [model1, model2, ...]
  tag: [tag1, tag2, ...]
  # Optional fields
  risk: [score1, score2, ...]
  year: 2023
  cve: ["123", "456", ...]
  cwe: ["123", "456", ...]
  capec: ["123", "456", ...]
  vref: ["vendor-ref1", ...]
  ...: ...
```

Above, we show an AD represented as a YAML object. The AD includes a set of
*primary fields*:
* unique name (`ad_name`)
* attack description (`a`)
* high-level defense policies and concrete defense mechanisms (`d: policy1: [mech1, mech2]`)
* attack surface (`surf`)
* attack vector (`vect`)
* general-purpose tags (`tag`)

Moreover, the AD is extensible with *optional fields*. Below we describe some
that we used in our experiments:
* risk scores (`risk`)
* threat year (`year`)
* CWE, CVE, and CAPEC IDs (`cve`, `cwe`, `capec`)
* vendor references (`vref`)

To see other AD representations look at [template/](template).


## Modules

The ADF has *four* modules:

1. **Catalogue** contains a curated collection of YAML files. Each file
   includes a collection of ADs for a threat domain (see [catalog/](catalog)).
2. **Analyze**: describe analyze API (`analyze.py`) and tests (`analyze_test.py`).
3. **Check**: describe analyze API (`check.py`) and tests (`check_test.py`).
4. **Parse**: describe analyze API (`parse.py`) and tests (`parse_test.py`).

## Cryptowallet case study

We evaluated the ADF by running a threat modeling exercise on a
*cryptowallet (product)*
and its *life cycle (process)*.
We involved seven expert groups covering orthogonal threat categories spanning
hardware, software, firmware, security, privacy, and protocols.

1. **Security Pattern** (lead: Cristalli) covered *process threats from
   the ISA/IEC 62443-4-1 standard*.
   They produced 40 ADs in [62443-4-1/](yaml/62443-4-1).
2. **KUL COSIC** (lead: De Meulemeester) covered *side channel and
   fault injection threats*.
   They produced 20 ADs in [sc-fi.yaml](yaml/sc-fi.yaml)
3. **KUL DistriNet** (lead: Bognar) covered *microarchitectural and speculative execution threats*.
   They produced 14 ADs in [microa.yaml](yaml/microa.yaml).
4. **NXP Germany** (lead: Bezsmertnyi) covered *presilicon RISC-V secure element threats*.
   They produced 8 ADs in [presil.yaml](yaml/presil.yaml).
5. **Texplained** (lead: Thomas) covered *invasive physical IC threats*.
   They produced 26 ADs in [physical.yaml](yaml/physical.yaml).
6. **EURECOM** (lead: Sacchetti) covered *BLE protocol and implementation threats*.
   They produced 46 ADs in [bt.yaml](yaml/bt.yaml).
7. **Security Pattern** (lead: Gringiani) covered *FIDO2 authentication threats*.
   They produced 21 ADs in [fido_device.yaml](yaml/fido_device.yaml),
   [fido_solokey.yaml](yaml/fido_solokey.yaml), and
   [fido_system.yaml](yaml/fido_system.yaml).


## Tests

We use `pytest` and `make`.

Test all modules:

```make
make test
```

Test `modname`:

```make
make test-modname
```

ADF.
