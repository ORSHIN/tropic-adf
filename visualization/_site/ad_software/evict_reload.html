<h2>Description</h2>
If the attacker and the victim have shared memory, the attacker can observe the victim's behavior regarding this shared memory by observing the cache state. If the attacker evicts a shared value of interest from the cache, then loads the value again after the victim's execution, based on the time taken it can determine whether the victim accessed the same value.
