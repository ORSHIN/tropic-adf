<h2>Description</h2>
Even without shared memory, the attacker can observe the victim's behavior regarding certain memory addresses by observing the cache state. If the attacker sets up the cache to a known state, then observes which values were evicted, it learns some information about the victim's execution, depending on the cache organization and replacement policy.
